CPSC 589 Final Project
By: Manveet Mandal and Mika Boba

This is based on the project starter code provided on D2L and compiles in the same way.
We build it using:
Cmake -H. -Bbuild
and then we use "make" to compile. 

Run using "589-689-3D-skeleton.exe"

There are two main editing modes: "Default" and "Editing".

In default you can see the tensor product surface. Using left-click + drag a user can move points around. 
Select "enable brush tool" to enable the brush tool. Use left-click plus drag to use the brush. With the brush a user can select the brush size (radius),
brush strength, noise scale (strength of noise), and noise amplitude (how noisy to generate).
